This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the","copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The","\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"","means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work","containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated","into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term","\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".<br><br>","Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they","are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the","Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of","having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program","does.<br><br>","1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in","any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an","appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to","this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a","copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br>","You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer","warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>","2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work","based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of","Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>","a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files","and the date of any change.<br><br>","b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is","derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third","parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>","c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it,","when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an","announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or","else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these","conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program","itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the","Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>","These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work","are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate","works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you","distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole","which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this","License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and","every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>","Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written","entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or","collective works based on the Program.<br><br>","In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or","with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not","bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br><br>","3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object","code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one","of the following:<br><br>","a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be","distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software","interchange; or,<br><br>","b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a","charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machinereadable","copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1","and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>","c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding","source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you","received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with","Subsection b above.)<br><br>","The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.","For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it","contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation","and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed","need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the","major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable","runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>","If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated","place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as","distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source","along with the object code.<br><br>","4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided","under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program","is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who","have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses","terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>","5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing","else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These","actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or","distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of","this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the","Program or works based on it.<br><br>","6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient","automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the","Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on","the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing","compliance by third parties to this License.<br><br>","7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other","reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,","agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you","from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your","obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you","may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree","redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through","you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from","distribution of the Program.<br><br>","If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,","the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in","other circumstances.<br><br>","It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right","claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the","integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license","practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software","distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the","author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and","a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br><br>","This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest","of this License.<br><br>","8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents","or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this","License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that","distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License","incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>","9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public","License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but","may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>","Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number","of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the","terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software","Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose","any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>","10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution","conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is","copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we","sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving","the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of","software generally.<br><br>","NO WARRANTY<br><br>","11.

You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or","the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on","the explanations below.<br><br>","When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General","Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free","software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you","want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you","are informed that you can do these things.<br><br>","To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these","rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.

If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to","the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and","recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br>","We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you","this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br>","To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free","library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should","know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will","not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br><br>","Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to","make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a","restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a","version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br>","Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public","License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated","libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for","certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br><br>","When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the","combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.","The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination","fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for","linking other code with the library.<br><br>","We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's","freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers","Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we","use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides","advantages in certain special circumstances.<br><br>","For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use","of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs","must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as","widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free","software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br>","In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater","number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C","Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,","as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br><br>","Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does","ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the","wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.","The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close","attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the","library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined","with the library in order to run.<br><br>","TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>","0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a","notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under","the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work","with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".","Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the","scope of this License.<br><br>","However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a","derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that","uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for","distribution of such executables.<br><br>","When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library,","the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code","is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library,","or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br>","If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and","small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file","is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this","object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br><br>","Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the","work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section","6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br>","6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the","Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that","work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the","customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br>","You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that","the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the","work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the","Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also,","you must do one of these things:<br><br>","a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for","the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed","under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with","the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source","code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified","executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the","contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the","application to use the modified definitions.)<br><br>","b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable","mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's","computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will","operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the","modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br><br>","c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same","user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of","performing this distribution.<br><br>","d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,","offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.","e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already","sent this user a copy.<br><br>","For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data","and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special","exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed","(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the","operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the","executable.<br><br>","It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary","libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you","cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br><br>","7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single","library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a","combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of","the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br>","a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,","uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the","Sections above.<br><br>","b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based","on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same","work.<br><br>","8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly","provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or","distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.","However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have","their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>","9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing","else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These","actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your","obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you","may not distribute the Library at all.

(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term","\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".<br><br>","Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they","are outside its scope.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work","based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of","Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>","a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files","and the date of any change.<br><br>","b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is","derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third","parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>","c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it,","when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an","announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or","else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these","conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program","itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the","Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>","These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or","the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on","the explanations below.<br><br>","When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General","Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free","software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you","want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you","are informed that you can do these things.<br><br>","To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these","rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.

If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to","the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and","recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br>","We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you","this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br>","To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free","library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should","know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will","not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br><br>","Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to","make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a","restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a","version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br>","Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public","License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated","libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for","certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br><br>","When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the","combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.","The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination","fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for","linking other code with the library.<br><br>","We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's","freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers","Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we","use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides","advantages in certain special circumstances.<br><br>","For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use","of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs","must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as","widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free","software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br>","In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater","number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C","Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,","as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br><br>","Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does","ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the","wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.","The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close","attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the","library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined","with the library in order to run.<br><br>","TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>","0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a","notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under","the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").

A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative","work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either","verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.","(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)","\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.","For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any","associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of","the library.<br><br>","Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they","are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output","from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library","(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on","what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br><br>","1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you","receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each","copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that","refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License","along with the Library.<br><br>","You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer","warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>","2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work","based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of","Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:","a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br><br>","b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the","files and the date of any change.<br><br>","c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under","the terms of this License.<br><br>","d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by","an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the","facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an","application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs","whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br><br>","(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely","well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any","application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the","application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br><br>","These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work","are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate","works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you","distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole","which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this","License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and","every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>","Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written","entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or","collective works based on the Library.<br><br>","In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with","a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the","other work under the scope of this License.<br><br>","3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this","License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this","License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to","this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has","appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in","these notices.<br><br>","Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU","General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that","copy.<br><br>","This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is","not a library.<br><br>","4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in","object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you","accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be","distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software","interchange.<br><br>","If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then","offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement","to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along","with the object code.<br><br>","5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work","with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".","Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the","scope of this License.<br><br>","However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a","derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that","uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for","distribution of such executables.<br><br>","When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library,","the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code","is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library,","or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br>","If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and","small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file","is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this","object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br><br>","Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the","work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section","6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br>","6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the","Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that","work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the","customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br>","You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that","the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the","work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the","Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also,","you must do one of these things:<br><br>","a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for","the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed","under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with","the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source","code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified","executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the","contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the","application to use the modified definitions.)<br><br>","b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable","mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's","computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will","operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the","modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br><br>","c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same","user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of","performing this distribution.<br><br>","d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,","offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.","e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already","sent this user a copy.<br><br>","For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data","and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special","exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed","(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the","operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the","executable.<br><br>","It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary","libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you","cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br><br>","7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single","library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a","combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of","the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br>","a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,","uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the","Sections above.<br><br>","b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based","on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same","work.<br><br>","8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly","provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or","distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.","However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have","their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>","9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing","else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These","actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or","distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this","License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the","Library or works based on it.<br><br>","10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient","automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify","the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on","the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing","compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>","11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other","reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,","agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you","from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your","obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you","may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree","redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through","you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from","distribution of the Library.<br><br>","If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,","the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in","other circumstances.<br><br>","It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right","claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the","integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license","practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software","distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the","author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and","a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br><br>","This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest","of this License.<br><br>","12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents","or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this","License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that","distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License","incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>","13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General","Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present","version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>","Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number","of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the","terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software","Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any","version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>","14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution","conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software","which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we","sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving","the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of","software generally.<br><br>","NO WARRANTY<br><br>","15.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software","\t\t\t\t\t\tis free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser","\t\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br><br> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute","\t\t\t\t\t\tcopies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or","\t\t\t\t\t\tif you modify it.<br><br> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And","\t\t\t\t\t\tyou must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what","\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<br><br> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors","\t\t\t\t\t\tof a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br><br> The precise terms","\t\t\t\t\t\tand conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br><br><br><br> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br><br> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which","\t\t\t\t\t\tcontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or","\t\t\t\t\t\tany derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".<br><br> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;","\t\t\t\t\t\tkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring","\t\t\t\t\t\ta copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications","\t\t\t\t\t\tor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br> a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br> b) You","\t\t\t\t\t\tmust cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br> c) If","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice","\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive","\t\t\t\t\t\tbut does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as","\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br> a) Accompany it with the complete","\t\t\t\t\t\tcorresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br> b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,","\t\t\t\t\t\tto give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machinereadable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium","\t\t\t\t\t\tcustomarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br> c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source","\t\t\t\t\t\tcode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed","\t\t\t\t\t\tneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties","\t\t\t\t\t\tare not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full","\t\t\t\t\t\tcompliance.<br><br> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you","\t\t\t\t\t\tdo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the","\t\t\t\t\t\tProgram or works based on it.<br><br> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these","\t\t\t\t\t\tterms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br><br> 7. If, as a consequence of a court","\t\t\t\t\t\tjudgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse","\t\t\t\t\t\tyou from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,","\t\t\t\t\t\tif a patent license would not permit royaltyfree redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution","\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Program.<br><br> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution","\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem, which is implemented by public license practices.

In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br> 9. The Free Software","\t\t\t\t\t\tFoundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br> Each version","\t\t\t\t\t\tis given a distinguishing version number.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim","\t\t\t\t\t\tcopies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br> Preamble","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software","\t\t\t\t\t\tis free for all its users.<br><br> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use","\t\t\t\t\t\tit too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br><br> When we speak of free software, we","\t\t\t\t\t\tare referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get","\t\t\t\t\t\tit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br><br> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny","\t\t\t\t\t\tyou these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br><br> For example, if you distribute copies of the library,","\t\t\t\t\t\twhether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also,","\t\t\t\t\t\tif the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,","\t\t\t\t\t\twe insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public","\t\t\t\t\t\tLicense. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries","\t\t\t\t\t\tinto non-free programs.<br><br> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public","\t\t\t\t\t\tLicense therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br><br> We call this license the \"Lesser\" General","\t\t\t\t\t\tPublic License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason","\t\t\t\t\t\twe use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br><br> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible","\t\t\t\t\t\tuse of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case,","\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use","\t\t\t\t\t\ta large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br><br> Although the Lesser","\t\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise","\t\t\t\t\t\tterms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the","\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br><br> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".<br><br> A \"library\" means a collection of software","\t\t\t\t\t\tfunctions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation","\t\t\t\t\t\tand installation of the library.<br><br> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from","\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library","\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes.<br><br> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer","\t\t\t\t\t\tof warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br><br> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you","\t\t\t\t\t\tmay at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br><br> b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files","\t\t\t\t\t\tand the date of any change.<br><br> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br> d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data","\t\t\t\t\t\tto be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table,","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br><br> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,","\t\t\t\t\t\tSubsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br><br> These requirements apply to","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections","\t\t\t\t\t\twhen you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees","\t\t\t\t\t\textend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br><br> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a","\t\t\t\t\t\tstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br><br> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,","\t\t\t\t\t\tyou must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,","\t\t\t\t\t\tthen you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br><br> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all","\t\t\t\t\t\tsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br><br> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable","\t\t\t\t\t\tform under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software","\t\t\t\t\t\tinterchange.","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though","\t\t\t\t\t\tthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called","\t\t\t\t\t\ta \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br><br> However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable","\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant","\t\t\t\t\t\tif the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,","\t\t\t\t\t\tand small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library","\t\t\t\t\t\twill still fall under Section 6.)<br><br> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether","\t\t\t\t\t\tor not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br> 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute","\t\t\t\t\t\tthat work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work","\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among","\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br><br> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes","\t\t\t\t\t\twere used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe application to use the modified definitions.)<br><br> b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer","\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the","\t\t\t\t\t\twork was made with.<br><br> c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\td) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials","\t\t\t\t\t\tor that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br> For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,","\t\t\t\t\t\tthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component","\t\t\t\t\t\titself accompanies the executable.","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in","\t\t\t\t\t\tan executable that you distribute.<br><br> 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined","\t\t\t\t\t\tlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the","\t\t\t\t\t\tsame work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br><br> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based","\t\t\t\t\t\ton the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically","\t\t\t\t\t\tterminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br> 9. You are not required","\t\t\t\t\t\tto accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying","\t\t\t\t\t\tor distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br><br> 10. Each time","\t\t\t\t\t\tyou redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose","\t\t\t\t\t\tany further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br> 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent","\t\t\t\t\t\tinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this","\t\t\t\t\t\tLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not","\t\t\t\t\t\tpermit royaltyfree redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br> It is not the purpose","\t\t\t\t\t\tof this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented","\t\t\t\t\t\tby public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is","\t\t\t\t\t\twilling to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br><br> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br> 12. If the distribution","\t\t\t\t\t\tand/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding","\t\t\t\t\t\tthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish","\t\t\t\t\t\trevised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br> Each version is given a","\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published","\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br> 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs","\t\t\t\t\t\twhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.","\t\t\t\t\t\tOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br> NO WARRANTY<br><br> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE","\t\t\t\t\t\tOF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED","\t\t\t\t\t\tOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME","\t\t\t\t\t\tTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.","\t\t\t\t\t\t<br><br> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,","\t\t\t\t\t\tSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY","\t\t\t\t\t\tTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS","\t\t\t\t\t</div>","\t\t\t\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">","\t\t\t\t\t\ta.link {","\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcolor: #000000;","\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext-decoration: underline;","\t\t\t\t\t\t}","\t\t\t\t\t</style>","","\t\t\t\t"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":1673.5,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":264,"column":42},"end":{"row":264,"column":42},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":110,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/html"}},"timestamp":1473346353428,"hash":"cb1562803460d686a919be43cdb85f02b4d33e8d"}
