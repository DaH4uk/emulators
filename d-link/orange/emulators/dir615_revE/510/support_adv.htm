1.5Mbps/284kbps. For this example, you would enter "284". Alternatively 
you can test your uplink speed with a service such as <a

that sites such as DSL Reports, because they do not consider as many 
network protocol overheads, will generally note speeds slightly lower

                in which you are actually connected via xDSL but for which you 
                configure either "Static" or "DHCP" in the WAN settings, setting 
                this option to <SPAN class=option>xDSL or Other Frame Relay 
                Network</SPAN> ensures that the router will recognize that it 
                needs to shape traffic slightly differently in order to give the

some of these options can interact with other port restrictions. 
Endpoint Independent Filtering takes priority over inbound filters or 
schedules, so it is possible for an incoming session request related to 
an outgoing session to enter through a port in spite of an active 
inbound filter on that port. However, packets will be rejected as 
expected when sent to blocked ports (whether blocked by schedule or by 
inbound filter) for which there are no active sessions. Port and Address
 Restricted Filtering ensures that inbound filters and schedules work 
precisely, but prevents some level of connectivity, and therefore might 
require the use of port triggers, virtual servers, or port forwarding to
 open the ports needed by the application. Address Restricted Filtering 
gives a compromise position, which avoids problems when communicating 
with certain other types of NAT router (symmetric NATs in particular) 
but leaves inbound filters and scheduled access working as expected.</p>

following loose correspondences between the "cone" classification and

behavior; address restricted filtering implements restricted cone

			              </dt><dd>
			              <p>DMZ means 
"Demilitarized Zone." If an application has trouble working from behind 
the router, you can expose one computer to the Internet and run the 
application on that computer.</p>
			              <p>When a LAN 
host is configured as a DMZ host, it becomes the destination for all 
incoming packets that do not match some other incoming session or rule. 
If any other ingress rule is in place, that will be used instead of 
sending packets to the DMZ host; so, an active session, virtual server, 
active port trigger, or port forwarding rule will take priority over 
sending a packet to the DMZ host. (The DMZ policy resembles a default 
port forwarding rule that forwards every port that is not specifically 
sent anywhere else.)</p>
			              <p>The router 
provides only limited firewall protection for the DMZ host. The router 
does not forward a TCP packet that does not match an active DMZ session,
 unless it is a connection establishment packet (SYN). Except for this 
limited protection, the DMZ host is effectively "outside the firewall". 
Anyone considering using a DMZ host should also consider running a 
firewall on that DMZ host system to provide additional protection.</p>
			              <p>Packets 
received by the DMZ host have their IP addresses translated from the 
WAN-side IP address of the router to the LAN-side IP address of the DMZ 
host. However, port numbers are not translated; so applications on the 
DMZ host can depend on specific port numbers.</p>
			              <p>The DMZ 
capability is just one of several means for allowing incoming requests 
that might appear unsolicited to the NAT. In general, the DMZ host 
should be used only if there are no other alternatives, because it is 
much more exposed to cyberattacks than any other system on the LAN. 
Thought should be given to using other configurations instead: a virtual
 server, a port forwarding rule, or a port trigger. Virtual servers open
 one port for incoming sessions bound for a specific application (and 
also allow port redirection and the use of ALGs). Port forwarding is 
rather like a selective DMZ, where incoming traffic targeted at one or 
more ports is forwarded to a specific LAN host (thereby not exposing as 
many ports as a DMZ host). Port triggering is a special form of port 
forwarding, which is activated by outgoing traffic, and for which ports 
are only forwarded while the trigger is active.</p>
			              <p>Few 
applications truly require the use of the DMZ host. Following are 
examples of when a DMZ host might be required:</p>
			              <ul>
			                <li>A host 
needs to support several applications that might use overlapping ingress
 ports such that two port forwarding rules cannot be used because they 
would potentially be in conflict.
			                </li><li>To 
handle incoming connections that use a protocol other than ICMP, TCP, 
UDP, and IGMP (also GRE and ESP, when these protocols are enabled by the

with the same or with different VPN servers. When the PPTP ALG is 
disabled, the router allows VPN operation in a restricted way.  LAN 
computers are typically able to establish VPN tunnels to different VPN 
Internet servers but not to the same server. The advantage of disabling

The value may be lower than that reported by your ISP as it does not

stated uplink speed for xDSL connections and around 5 kbps lower for 
cable network connections.

Uplink Speed

Automatic Uplink Speed is disabled, this option allows you to set the 
uplink speed manually. Uplink speed is the speed at which data can be 
transferred from the router to your ISP. This is determined by your ISP.
 ISPs often specify speed as a downlink/uplink pair; for example, 
1.5Mbps/284kbps. For this example, you would enter "284". Alternatively 
you can test your uplink speed with a service such as <a 
href="http://www.dslreports.com/">www.dslreports.com</a>. Note however 
that sites such as DSL Reports, because they do not consider as many 
network protocol overheads, will generally note speeds slightly lower 
than the Measured Uplink Speed or the ISP rated speed.
                <!--DT>Connection Type

                in which you are actually connected via xDSL but for which you

                this option to <SPAN class=option>xDSL or Other Frame Relay 
                Network</SPAN> ensures that the router will recognize that it 
                needs to shape traffic slightly differently in order to give the 
                best performance. Choosing <SPAN class=option>xDSL or Other 
                Frame Relay Network</SPAN> causes the measured uplink speed to 
                be reported slightly lower than before on such connections, but 
                gives much better results.

exposure by specifying the IP addresses of internet hosts that you trust

unsolicited incoming requests on any port, thereby making your LAN 
invisible to Internet cyberattackers. However, some network applications
 cannot run with a tight firewall. Those applications need to 
selectively open ports in the firewall to function correctly. The

numbers are within the valid range for the session, discarding those 
packets that do not have valid sequence numbers.

 applications (P2P applications in particular) to behave almost as if 
they are directly connected to the Internet.

			                </dt><dd>The

			              <p>Note that 
some of these options can interact with other port restrictions. 
Endpoint Independent Filtering takes priority over inbound filters or 
schedules, so it is possible for an incoming session request related to 
an outgoing session to enter through a port in spite of an active 
inbound filter on that port. However, packets will be rejected as 
expected when sent to blocked ports (whether blocked by schedule or by 
inbound filter) for which there are no active sessions. Port and Address
 Restricted Filtering ensures that inbound filters and schedules work 
precisely, but prevents some level of connectivity, and therefore might 
require the use of port triggers, virtual servers, or port forwarding to
 open the ports needed by the application. Address Restricted Filtering 
gives a compromise position, which avoids problems when communicating 
with certain other types of NAT router (symmetric NATs in particular) 
but leaves inbound filters and scheduled access working as expected.</p>

the behavior of this router's NAT. While not a perfect mapping, the 
following loose correspondences between the "cone" classification and 
the "endpoint filtering" modes can be drawn: if this router is 
configured for endpoint independent filtering, it implements full cone 
behavior; address restricted filtering implements restricted cone 
behavior; and port and address restricted filtering implements port 
restricted cone behavior.</p>

			              </dt><dd>
			              <p>DMZ means 
"Demilitarized Zone." If an application has trouble working from behind 
the router, you can expose one computer to the Internet and run the 
application on that computer.</p>
			              <p>When a LAN 
host is configured as a DMZ host, it becomes the destination for all 
incoming packets that do not match some other incoming session or rule. 
If any other ingress rule is in place, that will be used instead of 
sending packets to the DMZ host; so, an active session, virtual server, 
active port trigger, or port forwarding rule will take priority over 
sending a packet to the DMZ host. (The DMZ policy resembles a default 
port forwarding rule that forwards every port that is not specifically 
sent anywhere else.)</p>
			              <p>The router 
provides only limited firewall protection for the DMZ host. The router 
does not forward a TCP packet that does not match an active DMZ session,
 unless it is a connection establishment packet (SYN). Except for this 
limited protection, the DMZ host is effectively "outside the firewall". 
Anyone considering using a DMZ host should also consider running a 
firewall on that DMZ host system to provide additional protection.</p>
			              <p>Packets 
received by the DMZ host have their IP addresses translated from the 
WAN-side IP address of the router to the LAN-side IP address of the DMZ 
host. However, port numbers are not translated; so applications on the 
DMZ host can depend on specific port numbers.</p>
			              <p>The DMZ 
capability is just one of several means for allowing incoming requests 
that might appear unsolicited to the NAT. In general, the DMZ host 
should be used only if there are no other alternatives, because it is 
much more exposed to cyberattacks than any other system on the LAN. 
Thought should be given to using other configurations instead: a virtual
 server, a port forwarding rule, or a port trigger. Virtual servers open
 one port for incoming sessions bound for a specific application (and 
also allow port redirection and the use of ALGs). Port forwarding is 
rather like a selective DMZ, where incoming traffic targeted at one or 
more ports is forwarded to a specific LAN host (thereby not exposing as 
many ports as a DMZ host). Port triggering is a special form of port 
forwarding, which is activated by outgoing traffic, and for which ports 
are only forwarded while the trigger is active.</p>
			              <p>Few 
applications truly require the use of the DMZ host. Following are 
examples of when a DMZ host might be required:</p>
			              <ul>
			                <li>A host 
needs to support several applications that might use overlapping ingress
 ports such that two port forwarding rules cannot be used because they 
would potentially be in conflict.
			                </li><li>To 
handle incoming connections that use a protocol other than ICMP, TCP, 
UDP, and IGMP (also GRE and ESP, when these protocols are enabled by the
 PPTP and IPSec ALGs ).</li></ul>
