			              <p>The following 
options apply to all WAN modes. </p>

						  <p><span class="option">Advanced
 DNS :<br></span>
							 DNS stands for Domain
 Name System. The DNS servers act as a phonebook and translate the 
human-friendly domain name into its corresponding IP address. Advanced 
DNS Services for D-Link is powered by Best Path Networks, a subsidiary 
of OpenDNS that provides anti-phishing and DNS services to partners like
 D-Link. OpenDNS is the world’s largest and fastest-growing provider of 
free security and DNS infrastructure services. Advanced DNS Services 
makes your online experience safer and your Internet overall faster and 
more reliable.</p>
						  <p>The DNS platform 
is designed to not interfere with any specific protocol. However, a 
small subset of spam filtering solutions may be confused by receiving 
search responses for domains that do not exist. It is recommended that 
the enhanced search experience be disabled for clients that operate an 
on-site mail server. DNS does not affect upload or download speeds. 
These are controlled exclusively by your Internet Service Provider. 
D-Link and Best Path Networks do not collect or store any personally 
identifiable DNS information about Advanced DNS Services users.</p>
						  <p>Your search 
results are powered by Yahoo. The search function provides you with a 
much more fluid browsing experience. When a site cannot be reached, or a
 site does not exist, we will provide you with search suggestions 
instead of the generic error message displayed by your browser. We also 
automatically correct some of the common typos users make in the address
 bar. The typo-correction feature only works for top level domains that 
have been misspelled, such .cmo and .ogr. Sometimes you might be 
mis-directed to the search results page. If you clicked on a link in a 
spam email it is quite possible that the site has been disabled for 
abuse. Because the site no longer exists you may receive our search 
page. </p>

			              <p><span class="option">Primary
 DNS Server, Secondary DNS Server: 
			              </span>Enter the 
IP addresses of the DNS Servers. Leave the field for the secondary 
server empty if not used.</p>
			              <p><span class="option">MTU:</span>
 The Maximum Transmission Unit 
(MTU) is a parameter that determines the largest packet size (in bytes) 
that the router will send to the WAN. If LAN devices send larger 
packets, the router will break them into smaller packets. Ideally, you 
should set this to match the MTU of the connection to your ISP. Typical 
values are 1500 bytes for an Ethernet connection and 1492 bytes for a 
PPPoE connection. If the router's MTU is set too high, packets will be 
fragmented downstream. If the router's MTU is set too low, the router 
will fragment packets unnecessarily and in extreme cases may be unable 
to establish some connections. In either case, network performance can 
suffer. </p>
			              <p><span class="option">MAC
 Address:</span>Each 
networking device has it's own unique MAC address defined by the 
hardware manufacturer. Some ISP's may check your computer's MAC address.
 Some ISP's record the MAC address of the network adapter in the 
computer or router used to initially connect to their service. The ISP 
will then only grant Internet access to requests from a computer or 
router with this particular MAC address. This router has a different MAC
 address than the computer or router that initially connected to the 
ISP. If you need to change the MAC address of the router's WAN-side 
Ethernet interface, either type in an alternate MAC address (for 
example, the MAC address of the router initially connected to the ISP) 
or copy the MAC address of a PC. To copy the MAC address of the computer
 that initially connected to the ISP, connect to the D-Link router using
 that computer and click the <span class="button_ref">Clone Your PC's 
MAC Address</span> button. The WAN interface will then use the MAC 
address of the network adapter in your computer.</p>

 - using characters 0-9, A-F) or ASCII (American Standard Code for

requests sent to the router are forwarded to the ISP's DNS server. This

re-establishing the WAN connection. You should disable DNS relay if you

					                <p>The 
computers (and other devices) connected to your LAN also need to have 
their TCP/IP configuration set to "DHCP" or "Obtain an IP address

 IP Address Range 
					                </dt><dd>These
 two IP values (<i>from</i> and <i>to</i>) define a range of IP 
addresses that the DHCP Server uses when assigning addresses to 
computers and devices on your Local Area Network. Any addresses that are
 outside of this range are not managed by the DHCP Server; these could, 
therefore, be used for manually configured devices or devices that 
cannot use DHCP to obtain network address details automatically.
					                <p>It is 
possible for a computer or device that is manually configured to have an
 address that does reside within this range. In this case the address 
should be reserved (see <a href="support_internet.htm#Static_DHCP">Static DHCP Client</a> 
below), so that the DHCP Server knows that this specific address can 
only be used by a specific computer or device.</p>
					                <p>Your D-Link
 router, by default, has a static IP address of 192.168.0.1. This means 
that addresses 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.254 can be made available for 
allocation by the DHCP Server.</p>

					                <dl>
					                  <dt>Example:
					                  </dt><dd>Your
 D-Link router uses 192.168.0.1 for the IP address. You've assigned a 
computer that you want to designate as a Web server with a static IP 
address of 192.168.0.3. You've assigned another computer that you want 
to designate as an FTP server with a static IP address of 192.168.0.4. 
Therefore the starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs 
to be 192.168.0.5 or greater.
					                  </dd><dt>Example:

					                  </dt><dd>Suppose
 you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses From 192.168.0.100 To
 192.168.0.199. This means that 192.168.0.3 to 192.168.0.99 and 
192.168.0.200 to 192.168.0.254 are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. 
Computers or devices that use addresses from these ranges are to be 
manually configured. Suppose you have a web server computer that has a 
manually configured address of 192.168.0.100. Because this falls within 
the "managed range" be sure to create a reservation for this address and
 match it to the relevant computer (see <a href="support_internet.htm#Static_DHCP">Static

Lease Time
					                </dt><dd>The 
amount of time that a computer may have an IP address before it is 
required to renew the lease. The lease functions just as a lease on an 
apartment would. The initial lease designates the amount of time before 
the lease expires. If the tenant wishes to retain the address when the 
lease is expired then a new lease is established. If the lease expires 
and the address is no longer needed than another tenant may use the 
address.
					                </dd><dt>Always
 Broadcast 
					                </dt><dd>If 
all the computers on the LAN successfully obtain their IP addresses from
 the router's DHCP server as expected, this option can remain disabled. 
However, if one of the computers on the LAN fails to obtain an IP 
address from the router's DHCP server, it may have an old DHCP client 
that incorrectly turns off the broadcast flag of DHCP packets. Enabling 
this option will cause the router to always broadcast its responses to 
all clients, thereby working around the problem, at the cost of 
increased broadcast traffic on the LAN.

any, followed by local network broadcast. This is generally the 
preferred mode if you have configured WINS servers.
					                <br>M-Node 
(default), this indicates a Mixed-Mode of operation. First Broadcast 
operation is performed to register hosts and discover other hosts, if 
broadcast operation fails, WINS servers are tried, if any. This mode 
favours broadcast operation which may be preferred if WINS servers are 
reachable by a slow network link and the majority of network services 
such as servers and printers are local to the LAN.
					                <br>P-Node, this 
indicates to use WINS servers ONLY. This setting is useful to force all 
NetBIOS operation to the configured WINS servers. You must have 
configured at least the primary WINS server IP to point to a working 
WINS server.
					                <br>B-Node, this 
indicates to use local network broadcast ONLY. This setting is useful 
where there are no WINS servers available, however, it is preferred you 
try M-Node operation first.
